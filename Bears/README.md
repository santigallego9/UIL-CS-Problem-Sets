Hermit Joe lives in a desolate area of Alaska. The Alaskan Wildlife Management team has given him several maps of the area surrounding his cabin that show the location of the homes of different types of animals. The characters on the map represent different animals that live in the area. For example, the letter E represents an eagle's nest, the letter B represents a brown bear den, the letter M represents a moose habitat, etc. Joe is especially concerned about the brown bears living in the area. You are to write a program that, given a 10x10 rectangular grid of the area, will count the number of brown bear dens. Once Joe has this information, he will know which areas to avoid.

####Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of 10x10 maps to be checked. For each map, there will be ten lines with ten characters and no spaces on each line. All characters will be either an uppercase letter of the alphabet that represents an animal's home or a period (.) that represents an area without a major animal home.

####Output
For each map, you will print on a single line the number of brown bears living in the area represented by that map.
